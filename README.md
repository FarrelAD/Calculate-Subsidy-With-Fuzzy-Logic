This project calculates the amount of subsidy a farmer should receive based on **land area, rice production, and irrigation** using **Fuzzy Logic (Mamdani & Sugeno methods)**.

## Overview
We implemented this project using:
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for programmatic calculations)
- **Google Spreadsheets** (for spreadsheet-based calculations)

You can check out the Google Spreadsheets version here: üëâüèª https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipwiY-Wv5Mj8pgZsqjdQy0i00Ig4xAzas92i7rXQy8A/edit?usp=sharing

## Methods Used
- **Mamdani Method**  
- **Sugeno Method**  

Both methods were applied to determine the subsidy amount in different scenarios.
